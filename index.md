## Changing Territories and Cross-disciplinary Multi-Scale Analyses



This project falls within the field of digital humanities, in a context of methodological renewal driven by the democratisation of hardware and software devices dedicated to the digitisation of reality and data processing. It is interested in the study of territories at different scales and their transformations, focusing on the built heritage of which they are composed. In such a diachronic and multiscalar context, it seems necessary to study the scientific approaches undertaken within systems of multidisciplinary players to produce knowledge around the same object of study.

Based on the semantic enrichment of spatialised representations, the aim is to invent the mechanisms that will enable heterogeneous bodies of data to be better structured and linked in an nD context (note1), and then to study the methods of exploration, interrogation and correlation that will enable all aspects to be explored in order to produce new, perhaps unexpected, information. The approach envisaged is intended to be agile, and will involve the creation of tools that will act as intermediary objects, making it easier to aggregate the data and put it into perspective.

Note 1: by extension of 2D and 3D, the term nD refers to the n-Dimensional (multidimensional) nature of the data in a corpus. In the case of this project, the data can evolve in space (3D), as a function of time (3D+T = 4D), but can also refer to thematic dimensions. These cover information relevant to the user, characterising the nature, properties (state) and functions of the entity (object present in a building or more generally in the area).
